# Financial-Forecasting-with-Multi-layer-Perceptron-Neural-Network-MLP-NN-

This program utilizes time series analysis techniques, specifically employing a Multi-layer Perceptron Neural Network (MLP-NN), to forecast exchange rates, focusing on USD/EUR rates. The dataset consists of daily exchange rate data collected from October 2011 to October 2013. The program is designed to predict the next day's exchange rate based on autoregressive (AR) approaches, utilizing time-delayed values of the exchange rates as input variables.

Key Tasks:

Discuss the types of input variables used in MLP models for exchange rate forecasting, including the autoregressive (AR) approach.
Experiment with various input vectors up to (t-4) level to construct input/output matrices for MLP training/testing.
Normalize the input data and explain the rationale behind normalization for MLP structures.
Experiment with various MLP models, adjusting internal network structures such as hidden layers, nodes, and activation functions.
Evaluate the testing performance of each MLP model using standard statistical indices (RMSE, MAE, MAPE, sMAPE).
Create a comparison table of testing performances for different MLP structures and input vectors.
Analyze the efficiency of one-hidden layer and two-hidden layer networks based on the total number of weight parameters.
Provide graphical results and statistical ind
